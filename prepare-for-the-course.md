**4. Enable Online lab host** 

Labs are run through an Authorized Lab Hosters(ALHs) for Microsoft Official Curriculum.

The trainee does not choose which lab hoster he wants to use, this decision is made by the training center.

Testing the Lab hoster Environment
* [go deploy](https://lms.godeploy.it/DemoLabs/Register)
* [Skillable](https://www.skillable.com/demo-request/)
    * [Lab Orientation & Connectivity Check](https://labondemand.com/Launch/122B02AA)
* [Xtremelabs](https://xtremelabs.io/xtremelabs-products/testing/)
    * [Lab with multiple vms](https://labs.xtremelabs.io/ondemandconnection/launchlabbyalias?alias=demo-01)
    * [Lab with steps and self assessments](https://labs.xtremeconsulting.com/ondemandconnection/launchlabbyalias?alias=demo-02)

Troubleshooting
* Use Edge, Chrome, Firefox, or another HTML5 compliant browser
* Ensure you aren't connected to a VPN at the same time
* If you are on a corporate network, make sure your IT department doesn't have any firewall rules that would block access
    * [go deploy][https://docs.godeploy.it/general/connectivity-requirements]
    * [Skilable](https://docs.learnondemandsystems.com/tms/connectivity-requires.md)
    * [XtremeLabs](https://moc.microsoftlabsonline.com/content/skins/moc/self-servicestudentguidetomlos.pdf)
* If there is an issue with your local network configuration, a simple reboot may resolve it
* Lab host service status and active incident
    * [go deploy](https://status.skillable.com/)
    * [Skilable](https://status.skillable.com/)
    * [XtremeLabs](http://status.xtremelabs.io/)
* Testing Internet Connectivity
    * A [http://www.speedtest.net/](http://www.speedtest.net/) test should be carried out by selecting London or New York. 
    * Ensure there is a latency of less than 200ms. 
    * A latency of less than 150ms will give the best lab experience.

**Can I use my own device?**
* Yes, you just have to prepare your machine with all the necessary software. See the list of required software.
* However, it has the disadvantage that the instructor cannot help you directly. The Lab host provides functionality where the instructor directly interacts with your lab environment.
