| [[MS-RTASPF]: RTP for Application Sharing Payload Format Extensions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/office_protocols/ms-rtaspf/42824cea-064e-45b3-a81b-24584449d2eb) | Specifies the RTP Payload Format for Application Sharing Extensions, which is the payload format for transporting Application Sharing data using RTP packets. |
|  [[MS-RTP]: Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) Extensions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/office_protocols/ms-rtp/26dda764-6e96-456b-810b-9ae0275af564) | Specifies the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) Extensions, which describes a set of extensions to Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP). This extension provides a set of network transport functions suitable for applications transmitting real-time data, such as audio and video, across multimedia endpoints. This extension also provides bandwidth estimation, dominant speaker notification, video-packet loss recovery, and enhanced robustness for receivers. |
|  [[MS-RTPRADEX]: RTP Payload for Redundant Audio Data Extensions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/office_protocols/ms-rtpradex/c28f4661-9e7c-4319-b6e5-58d0dba6b823) | Specifies the RTP Payload for Redundant Audio Data Extensions, which is a set of extensions that describe a Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) payload format for encoding redundant audio data that provides redundancy when transmitting audio frames across a lossy network transport. |
| [[MS-SDPEXT]: Session Description Protocol (SDP) Version 2.0 Extensions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/office_protocols/ms-sdpext/cd17a549-b948-42a6-aa6b-fa707710faac) | Specifies the Session Description Protocol (SDP) Extensions, which is a protocol that negotiates audio/video call setup and adds video or audio to an existing audio-only or video-only call. |
