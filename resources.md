| [[MS-RTASPF]: RTP for Application Sharing Payload Format Extensions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/office_protocols/ms-rtaspf/42824cea-064e-45b3-a81b-24584449d2eb) | Specifies the RTP Payload Format for Application Sharing Extensions, which is the payload format for transporting Application Sharing data using RTP packets. |
|  [[MS-RTP]: Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) Extensions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/office_protocols/ms-rtp/26dda764-6e96-456b-810b-9ae0275af564) | Specifies the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) Extensions, which describes a set of extensions to Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP). This extension provides a set of network transport functions suitable for applications transmitting real-time data, such as audio and video, across multimedia endpoints. This extension also provides bandwidth estimation, dominant speaker notification, video-packet loss recovery, and enhanced robustness for receivers. |
|  [[MS-RTPRADEX]: RTP Payload for Redundant Audio Data Extensions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/office_protocols/ms-rtpradex/c28f4661-9e7c-4319-b6e5-58d0dba6b823) | Specifies the RTP Payload for Redundant Audio Data Extensions, which is a set of extensions that describe a Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) payload format for encoding redundant audio data that provides redundancy when transmitting audio frames across a lossy network transport. |
| [[MS-SDPEXT]: Session Description Protocol (SDP) Version 2.0 Extensions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/office_protocols/ms-sdpext/cd17a549-b948-42a6-aa6b-fa707710faac) | Specifies the Session Description Protocol (SDP) Extensions, which is a protocol that negotiates audio/video call setup and adds video or audio to an existing audio-only or video-only call. |
| [[MS-SIPAE]: Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Authentication Extensions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/office_protocols/ms-sipae/ba3e9821-fa85-4e0f-a80c-5a4c720a00bd) | Specifies the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Authentication Extensions, which defines NT LAN Manager (NTLM) and Kerberos authentication schemes based on general authentication framework guidelines. | 
| [[MS-SIPAPP]: Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Application Protocol](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/office_protocols/ms-sipapp/2cc5f99e-7190-4672-bb24-6dc9c6347019) | Specifies the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Application Protocol, which is a collection of independent proprietary client-server protocols that are used to provide enhanced functionality to Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)-based communication systems. |
| [[MS-SIPCOMP]: Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Compression Protocol](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/office_protocols/ms-sipcomp/eaf7bc25-7128-454a-841e-539dfca2207d) | Specifies the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Compression Protocol, which is the negotiation mechanism and compression algorithm used to signal traffic compression between the client and the server. | 
| [[MS-SIPRE]: Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Routing Extensions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/office_protocols/ms-sipre/ab4ab249-3796-4ed1-8cec-f496d81a1a83) | Specifies the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Routing Extensions, which are Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) routing extensions to provide endpoint identification, phone number resolution, call routing processing by server on user's behalf, and enhanced routing within topologies with multiple redundant servers, firewalls, and NAT devices. |
| [[MS-SIPREGE]: Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Registration Extensions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/office_protocols/ms-siprege/21acf797-984c-48ce-97e3-c7df5c776b3d)  | Specifies the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Registration Extensions, which are the extensions to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) registration procedure. This protocol also defines the data format and the mechanism to retrieve in-band provisioning data, which are necessary for client sign in. |
| [[MS-SSRTP]: Scale Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SSRTP) Extensions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/office_protocols/ms-ssrtp/980fc2b6-ba83-4313-9f5a-cad50449e98e) | Specifies the Scale Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SSRTP) Extensions, which is a set of extensions to Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP). This protocol improves performance for situations where a unique Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) payload is distributed to multiple receivers. This protocol differs from SRTP in packet format, encryption parameters, and message authentication processing. |
| [[MS-RTVPF]: RTP Payload Format for RT Video Streams Extensions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/office_protocols/ms-rtvpf/3f37858b-c991-41c4-bbbd-df10fcffc89e) | Specifies the RTP Payload Format for RT Video Streams Extensions, which are extensions to the payload format defined for encapsulating an RT Video bit stream in Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP). |
| [[MS-SDPEXT]: Session Description Protocol (SDP) Version 2.0 Extensions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/office_protocols/ms-sdpext/cd17a549-b948-42a6-aa6b-fa707710faac) | Specifies the Session Description Protocol (SDP) Extensions, which is a protocol that negotiates audio/video call setup and adds video or audio to an existing audio-only or video-only call.|
|[[MS-RTPDT]: Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP/RTCP): DTMF Digits, Telephony Tones and Telephony Signals Data Extensions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-rtpdt/3da5c85e-d7a6-4c67-9253-034f1b11de3a) | Specifies the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP/RTCP): DTMF Digits, Telephony Tones, and Telephony Signals Data Extensions, which describes the payload format needed to carry DTMF digits, tones, and signals in RTP packets over a network transport. |
| [[MS-TURNBWM]: Traversal using Relay NAT (TURN) Bandwidth Management Extensions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/office_protocols/ms-turnbwm/7fd11bbc-3e10-476c-80be-9d62b1b35b1a) | Specifies the Traversal using Relay NAT (TURN) Bandwidth Management Extensions to the TURN protocol to provide support for controlling access to network bandwidth. |
| [[MS-TURNBWM]: Traversal using Relay NAT (TURN) Bandwidth Management Extensions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/office_protocols/ms-turnbwm/7fd11bbc-3e10-476c-80be-9d62b1b35b1a) | Specifies the Traversal using Relay NAT (TURN) Bandwidth Management Extensions to the TURN protocol to provide support for controlling access to network bandwidth. ~
